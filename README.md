# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate how various sorting algorithms work in real-time. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project provides a visual and educational representation of popular sorting algorithms, helping users understand their inner workings and efficiency.

## Features

- **Algorithm Support**: Visualizes popular sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Shows step-by-step transitions of the sorting process in real time.
- **Customizable Input**: Allows users to adjust:
  - The size of the array to sort.
  - The speed of the visualization.
- **Interactive UI**: Intuitive controls for starting, pausing, or resetting the visualization.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on devices of all screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. **Input Options**:
   - Users can generate a random array of elements to sort.
   - Adjust sliders to control array size and visualization speed.
2. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - Choose from a list of supported sorting algorithms.
3. **Visualization**:
   - The selected algorithm animates the sorting process step-by-step, dynamically updating the display.
4. **Controls**:
   - Start, pause, and reset the visualization at any time.
